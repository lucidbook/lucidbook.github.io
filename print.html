<a class="header" href="print.html#the-basics" id="the-basics"><h1>The Basics</h1></a>
<p>So you’re interested in lucid dreaming, great!
Welcome to the start of your journey into entirely different worlds.</p>
<p>This guide will explain the basics of lucid dreaming, basic terminology, and how
to get yourself started with the most basic of lucid dreaming techniques,
“reality checks”.
From there it will guide you into what to try next in your lucid dreams, the
basics of dream control, and what other lucid dreaming techniques to try.
This guide is ordered in sequence of what information will be most relevant to
you at your level of understanding after reading the previous chapter, but it
can be read in any order you want.</p>
<p>Remember to relax and stay persistent, this might take a while.
Enjoy the ride, even if you <em>really</em> want to reach the destination!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#wait-what-is-lucid-dreaming" id="wait-what-is-lucid-dreaming"><h2>Wait, what is lucid dreaming?</h2></a>
<p>Lucid dreaming as its very basic form is being aware that you’re dreaming.
This is also called being “lucid”.
If this sounds completely normal to you, you may be someone who naturally lucid
dreams.
Most people don’t naturally do this however, and have to train themselves to
become lucid in dreams.
The term is also used as an umbrella term for actually making use of this
lucidity.
Being lucid gives you a lot of power over the dream world itself, you can do
anything you want in a dream.</p>
<p>If you’ve never heard of this before, this may sound like a concept completely
foreign to you, or even like pseudoscience paranormal gobbledygook.
Lucid dreaming however is widely acknowledged as a real thing, even in
psychology.
Everyone can learn to lucid dream and there’s nothing paranormal about it.
While for some people it can be a jumping board into paranormal experiences,
this book will not go into that or comment on the validity of it.
If you’re interested in these things that’s alright, you do you, this book just
won’t help you with that beyond lucid dreaming itself.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#but-its-a-dream-wont-it-all-feel-fake" id="but-its-a-dream-wont-it-all-feel-fake"><h2>But it’s a dream, won’t it all feel fake?</h2></a>
<p>It’s technically all imagined yes, but that doesn’t mean it’s not real to your
mind.
Lucid dreams can feel incredibly real, or even hyper-real as your senses in
dreams are not filtered interpretations of your real life sensory organs, but
direct feeds from the dream world.
People who wear glasses generally don’t need them in dreams.</p>
<p>This is not to say that dreams are indistinguishable from real life, in fact
there’s a lot of things that are very different.
These are just part of the experience, and allow you to change the world around
you, your own appearance, travel to different locations quickly, or do various
other interesting things you can’t do in real life.
Opening a door in a dream for example might lead nowhere, or somewhere
completely unexpected.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#but-i-dont-have-any-dreams" id="but-i-dont-have-any-dreams"><h2>But I don’t have any dreams</h2></a>
<p>Yes you do! Everyone has dreams, the hard part is remembering them.
But you can train this!
This guide has some tips and tricks on how to improve your dream recall from
nothing, to multiple dreams per day.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#but-wont-this-make-me-really-tired" id="but-wont-this-make-me-really-tired"><h2>But won’t this make me really tired?</h2></a>
<p>Nope!
Dreaming happens during REM sleep, which isn’t meant to give you rest.
You can spend every single dream completely lucid and not miss out on any rest
at all.
As well while lucid dreaming you may become more aware of how sleep works and
how to better plan in your sleep to be more rested overall.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#i-need-this-right-now-whats-the-fastest-way-to-do-this" id="i-need-this-right-now-whats-the-fastest-way-to-do-this"><h2>I need this <strong>RIGHT NOW</strong> what’s the fastest way to do this?</h2></a>
<p>Woah there, calm yourself down a bit.
Lucid dreaming certainly is very appealing, and a great experience, but rushing
to it won’t work.
There is no fastest way or quick easy way to reach a lucid dream, it takes time
and persistence, and figuring out what works for you.
(No matter how much some supplement sellers would like to convince you otherwise)</p>
<p>If you’re not feeling comfortable in your own body, or are suffering from
problems in your life, you may feel like you absolutely <em>need</em> to learn this.
This however will work against you.
Take a step back, figure out your life, talk to a therapist.
Escaping into a lucid dream won’t solve any problems for you, no matter how much
it sounds like a panacea.</p>
<p>You need to approach lucid dreaming with patience.
It’s likely that it’s going to take some time before you get into a lucid dream
where you can actually do the things you want to do.
Enjoy the journey.
Enjoy the benefits you get from all the techniques that help you achieve lucid
dreams.
Enjoy the weird experiences you get that aren’t lucid dreams but still something
different, something unique.</p>
<p>Take your time, enjoy the small victories and benefits, and before you know it
you’re suddenly standing in your own personal world, able to do whatever you
want.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#okay-how-do-i-start" id="okay-how-do-i-start"><h2>Okay, how do I start?</h2></a>
<p>Great!
Welcome to the start of your journey.
Remember that this is neither a sprint nor a marathon.
It’s a gentle walk in the park, and if you push yourself to run way too fast you
might just burn yourself out.
Move on to the next chapter of the guide.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dream-recall" id="dream-recall"><h1>Dream Recall</h1></a>
<p>So you’ve decided to learn lucid dreaming, where do you start?
Well, let’s start with a very common problem many people run in to, remembering
your dreams.
I mean, what’s the point in having a lucid dream if you don’t remember it?
And you’re also missing out on remembering tons of great adventures you’re
having every night!
There’s various methods for remembering dreams, in this chapter we’ll only be
going over the most common and reliable ones.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dream-journals" id="dream-journals"><h2>Dream Journals</h2></a>
<p>The staple of every lucid dreaming diet!
Dream journals are by far the most reliable technique for drastically improving
your recall.
Even if you barely ever remember your dreams this will help you a lot.</p>
<p>The easiest moment to remember your dreams is in the morning right after waking
up.
When you wake up, the first thing you should do is stay in bed, and try your
best possible to remember the dream you just had.
Spend some time on this, it’s alright if it takes a while, and it’s alright if
you can’t manage to remember it.</p>
<p>Now if you remembered a dream, write it down somewhere.
Write as many details as you can remember.
The more details you write, the more you’ll be able to remember this dream in
the future, and the more you’ll remember of dreams after this.
As you’re writing, you might be remembering even more, so keep writing all of
that down.
If you can’t remember anything, just write down “No dream recalled”.
Just make sure you write something every single day, this will keep your journal
as being important in your mind.</p>
<p>Doing this will signal to your mind that dream recall is important to you.
Over time you’ll find it easier and easier to remember dreams.
Most people leave it just at this technique but if you want to do some more...</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#recall-your-day" id="recall-your-day"><h2>Recall Your Day</h2></a>
<p>Right before sleeping or doing whatever technique you’re planning to do for
lucid dreaming, think back to your day.
Try to remember it from start to finish.
This will prime your mind for better recall during the night.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#its-not-working" id="its-not-working"><h2>It’s not working!</h2></a>
<p>Sometimes, you’ll just get a while where you’ll have no recall whatsoever.
This happens even to the most experienced lucid dreamers now and then.
Just keep journaling, even if you can’t remember anything, and eventually your
recall will come back.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#reality-checks" id="reality-checks"><h1>Reality Checks</h1></a>
<p>So you want to lucid dream, and now you know how to actually remember your
dreams, so what’s next?
You want to be able to know when you’re dreaming.
So, how do you know you’re in a dream?
Easy, you check if you are!</p>
<p>Reality checks are the bread and butter of lucid dreaming.
They’re the foundation most other techniques are based on.
The concept is simple, when you’re not sure if you’re dreaming or not, you
check!
You might have however seen a problem with this, you don’t just naturally tend
to ask yourself if you’re dreaming while in a dream.
We’ll get back to this in a bit but first...</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#so-how-exactly-do-i-do-a-reality-check" id="so-how-exactly-do-i-do-a-reality-check"><h2>So how exactly do I do a reality check?</h2></a>
<p>A reality check is really simple.
It’s just a few steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask yourself “Am I dreaming?”.
Don’t ask it for the sake of it.
You should <strong>really</strong> be doubting your reality.
Even if you did a check just before, you always might be in a dream.</li>
<li>Look around you, does anything look weird. If so, inspect it.</li>
<li>Ask yourself “How did I get here”, what did you do 5 minutes ago, how did you
get to the location you currently are?
Time often works differently in dreams, see if you can recognize a time
skip, or if you can’t remember how you got there.</li>
<li>Perform the reality check itself, here you perform an action that should tell
you for sure that you’re dreaming.
In this example we’re using the classic “Look at your hands” check.
<ul>
<li>Look at your palms</li>
<li>Check if they look as they normally do, how many fingers do you have,
don’t yet assume what the correct amount should be.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Say to yourself “Next time I am dreaming, I will reality check and realize
I’m dreaming.”.
This will incubate the idea of doing reality checks in your mind and help
bring that into your dreams.</li>
<li>Re-try your reality check a few times and keep saying that to yourself every
time.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you go to sleep, you should also repeat “Next time I am dreaming, I will
reality check and realize I’m dreaming.” to yourself as you’re falling asleep.
The reality check example given is a classic and simple one, but there’s various
others you can do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping your nose plugged/blocked and trying to breathe.</li>
<li>Trying to push your thumb through your palm.</li>
<li>Paying attention to gravity, see if it’s harder or easier to walk than it
should be.</li>
<li>Try to change something in your potential dream.</li>
<li>Try light switches, they don’t always work right in dreams.</li>
<li>Read some text, see if it’s hard to read or doesn’t make any sense.
Look away and back and again and see if it changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>In total doing a check shouldn’t take you too long and it won’t be interrupting
to your overall day.
You can do as many checks as you want and combine different ones, be creative!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#okay-but-how-do-i-remember-to-do-this-in-dreams" id="okay-but-how-do-i-remember-to-do-this-in-dreams"><h2>Okay, but how do I remember to do this in dreams?</h2></a>
<p>Well, one thing that will help is the mantra above, repeating to yourself that
you will be doing a check.
But there’s one important key thing to keep in mind when you start lucid
dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>You should never be sure you’re not dreaming, always assume you might be no
matter what.
A reality check can’t prove that you are in reality, it can only prove that
you’re not.
You should be living this, this should be on your mind all the time, that the
world you’re in might not be real.</strong></p>
<p>This is so incredibly key I can’t make it bold enough text.
You should <strong>always</strong> assume you might be dreaming, it is <strong>always</strong> a
possibility.
Living with this doubt may sound scary, but it isn’t!
Doubting your surroundings at all times makes you more aware of what’s happening
around you, and doesn’t take away from the experiences you have while awake.
Having this constant doubt about being awake is the first step to realizing that
you’re dreaming in a dream, but again we’ll get back to that in a bit.</p>
<p>Before we move on I should make a quick mention, if you doubting your reality
starts impacting your life in serious negative ways, you need to take a step
back and re-evaluate if this is the right path for you.
Some people suffer from mental disorders that make distinguishing between
reality and non-reality (hallucinations, dreams, etc.) extremely hard and if you
feel like you are experiencing that you should stop right then and contact a
therapist.
Prioritize your mental wellbeing over lucid dreaming.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#right-anything-else-i-can-do-to-remember-this" id="right-anything-else-i-can-do-to-remember-this"><h2>Right, anything else I can do to remember this?</h2></a>
<p>Sure!
A few more detailed tricks will be mentioned later in this guide but here’s a
few simple tricks you can make use of.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read back your dream journal (we’ll get to what that is later), and see if you
have any recurring dream signs that should help you recognize it’s a dream.</li>
<li>Perform a reality check whenever something common occurs that also happens in
your dreams.</li>
<li>Perform a reality check whenever you go through a door.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, the trick here is to create triggers that will cause you to reality
check.
You can also meditate to incubate these triggers into your dreams. (More on
meditation and incubation later in this guide)</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#if-i-do-all-of-this-will-i-get-a-lucid-dream" id="if-i-do-all-of-this-will-i-get-a-lucid-dream"><h2>If I do all of this, will I get a lucid dream?</h2></a>
<p>Yes! Eventually.
It’s going to take time, takes a different amount for everyone.
Some take a few days, others a few months.
The key is persistence and staying positive.
Say to yourself every night before sleeping that you <strong>will</strong> have a lucid
dream.
Really believe it, even if you’ve been going for weeks without success.</p>
<p>Eventually, you’ll get the small successes.
You’ll start being more aware in dreams, thinking more critically.
You start noticing things are weird, but perhaps not quite realizing yet.
And one day, you’ll suddenly be standing there, looking at your hands having 6
fingers.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#holy-crap-my-hands-have-6-fingers" id="holy-crap-my-hands-have-6-fingers"><h2>HOLY CRAP MY HANDS HAVE 6 FINGERS</h2></a>
<p>So you’ve suddenly realized you’re in a lucid dream, what next?
You’ll likely be very excited, the world around you may suddenly become a lot
more vivid.
Some however, then might wake up.</p>
<p>A common theory is that the excitement is what wakes you up, but this doesn’t
seem to line up with the experiences of regular lucid dreamers.
Rather, it seems that this theory has come from that beginner lucid dreamers
are all the more excited when they get their first lucid dream.
Rather, it’s just more likely to become lucid at the end of the dream, while
you’re already about to wake up.
As a result when you’re starting it’s likely that this is where you realize it’s
a dream.</p>
<p>If this happens to you (it may not), don’t worry about it!
You just managed to get another step closer to your goals and whatever you’re
doing is working!
Just keep going, eventually you’ll get longer lucid dreams!</p>
<p>What also may happen is that you don’t remember all (or any of) the things you
wanted to do when lucid dreaming.
This is normal as well, and it can really suck, but once again remember that
this is still a success!
You’ve managed to stick in the dream, that’s great!
Eventually you’ll get more aware of what you’re doing.
What also will help is using incubation to set a goal of what you’ll be doing in
the lucid dream.
More on that later in this guide.</p>
<p>Regardless of what happened, if you made it to this step you’ve done great!
You’ve set the first steps into your lucid dreaming adventure.
If you haven’t yet, that’s alright.
Just keep trying, and keep reading!
The rest of this guide will have a common lucid dreaming method that’s really
easy to make use of and very effective, some more tips to make it easier to
lucid dream, and tips to help you in the dreams when you become lucid.</p>

<p>Eventually, because of the barriers, you’ll do a reality check, feel or notice that something is wrong, or perhaps even notice the barriers themselves.</p>
<p>This technique can grant you <strong>omnilucidity</strong> in a very simple and fast manner.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#what-is-omnilucidity" id="what-is-omnilucidity"><h3>What is omnilucidity?</h3></a>
<p><strong>Omnilucidity</strong> is when you are lucid in every single dream you have.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#setting-up-a-barrier" id="setting-up-a-barrier"><h2>Setting up a barrier</h2></a>
<p>In order to set up a barrier, you will first need to have a lucid dream through other means. (DILD, MILD, WILD, ...)</p>
<p>Once you are in a lucid dream, you’re going to want to go (Preferably) to your bedroom, or to any place of your choice where you’d like to setup a <strong>spawning point</strong>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a-spawning-point-wha" id="a-spawning-point-wha"><h3>A spawning point? Wha?</h3></a>
<p>Yes, either your bed or a place of your choice, when setting up the barriers, you will spawn there every dream, it will make sense as you continue reading the guide.</p>
<p>Now that you have chosen the place where you’d like to spawn, you need to demark the spawning zone in some way, and in this example we’re gonna use “magical auras” to demark the spawning zone.</p>
<p>Wave your hands around as if you were going to do some magic, like energy manipulation, focus this energy and send it towards your spawn point as it slowly marks the contours of the spawn zone you wish. You should start to see a magical aura go out from your hand, and it will slowly trace the contours of your spawn point.</p>
<p>At the same time this happens, set up the following rules, either by thinking them, saying them out loud, or maybe even chanting it:</p>
<ul>
<li>“From now on, I will spawn in (Your place of choosing) in every single one of my future dreams.”</li>
<li>“I cannot go through the barriers, so long as I am not lucid.”</li>
<li>“If I am out of the barriers, I am already lucid.”</li>
</ul>
<p>That is about it, that’s the general idea on how you should proceed for it, but of course you can get creative and use something else instead of “magical auras” or perhaps even differently worded rules.</p>
<p>And now your barriers are done! Congrats! But you’re still not quite there just yet...</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#persisting-the-barriers" id="persisting-the-barriers"><h2>Persisting the barriers</h2></a>
<p>Now that you have setup your barriers, you’ll need to make them persistent, so that it actually carries out to your future dreams.</p>
<p>Doing so is fairly simple and may take anywhere from a day to a few days.</p>
<p>You’ll need to meditate and visualize those barriers you’ve just made. Visualize possible scenarios about it might play out in your next dream.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#heres-an-example" id="heres-an-example"><h3>Here’s an example</h3></a>
<p>Start your meditation, when you feel like it, start visualizing the beginning of a dream, you’ll start at your spawn zone, still not lucid and unaware that this is a dream.
However because of the rules you’ve just set, you’ll be stuck in this spawn zone, so you might try to get out or wonder why you cannot get out, <em>and that’s the thing, that is the trigger for lucidity</em>.</p>
<p>You will extremely likely start to ask yourself legitimate questions about why this is happening, may it be a dream? You will reality check at this point or just know you’re dreaming. Tada!</p>
<p>Now you are able to go through the barriers and get out of the spawn point because you are lucid now!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#after-a-day-or-a-few-days-of-meditation-and-visualization" id="after-a-day-or-a-few-days-of-meditation-and-visualization"><h3>After a day or a few days of meditation and visualization...</h3></a>
<p>That’s it! The barriers have now carried over to your future dreams, and now you will be getting lucid every dream! You’ll spawn at your spawn point, you will be stuck in this spawn point as the barriers do not let you through. You’ll wonder why this happens and suspect this is a dream, thus doing a reality check, and becoming lucid!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#maintaining-the-barriers" id="maintaining-the-barriers"><h2>Maintaining the barriers</h2></a>
<p>Alright, it isn’t <em>that</em> easy, you still have to maintain your barriers from time to time because they will slowly fade out eventually, leaving you with normal dreams again.</p>
<p>Once a week, simply go back to your spawn point and restrengthen your barriers by giving it some more energy, you can give some of your energy just like in the barrier induction part, or you can do something else that makes sense to you, get creative!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#help-my-barriers-are-fading--not-as-effective" id="help-my-barriers-are-fading--not-as-effective"><h3>Help! My barriers are fading / not as effective</h3></a>
<p>If your barriers start to fade, depending on the severity, you can meditate and visualize it to restrengthen it a little bit, go into a lucid dream, and restrenghten it from there.
Or if it’s too severe then I’m afraid you’ll have to go back to <a href="print.html#setting-up-a-barrier">setting up a barrier</a>, pay attention next time!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dissociation" id="dissociation"><h1>Dissociation</h1></a>
<p>Dissociation is the practice of “letting go” of your physical body, thoughts &amp; other senses.
Doing so can result in much more relaxed and focused meditation, much better visualization, along with easier dream induction via WILD or similar means.</p>
<p>You can dissociate pretty much any time you’d like, provided you are in a comfortable position and with minimal or no outside disturbances (Auditory, etc...), it is preferable to keep your eyes closed while dissociating.</p>
<p>For all of these methods, start by going into a comfortable position (If you’re unsure, just do the corpse position, lie on your back, arms lying down on the sides, no crossing of the legs).
Then close your eyes and begin some meditation at first, simply focus on your breathing for a few minutes.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dissociating-the-physical-body-via-ignoring-it" id="dissociating-the-physical-body-via-ignoring-it"><h2>Dissociating the physical body via ignoring it</h2></a>
<p>When you feel relaxed, begin to slowly ignore your body in an incremental manner, first your toes, then feet, legs, hands, arms, chest, torso and finally head.
If you keep focus on your breathing at all times, you’ll find that it becomes much easier to dissociate.</p>
<p>If on purpose ignoring a certain part of your body doesn’t make sense, that’s alright.
Not everyone can do that easily.
Try one of the following two alternatives instead.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dissociating-the-physical-body-via-amplifying-and-ignoring-it" id="dissociating-the-physical-body-via-amplifying-and-ignoring-it"><h3>Dissociating the physical body via amplifying and ignoring it</h3></a>
<p>If dissociating through simply ignoring your body doesn’t quite do the trick or takes a long time, you can try this method instead which may provide better results.</p>
<p>When you feel relaxed, begin to focus on your body (Stay aware of your breathing nonetheless) and “amplify” the feeling of your body, feel absolutely everything of your body, do that for a few minutes.
Then just suddenly ignore your body, shift your focus to solely your breathing only and dissociation will carry out very fast.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dissociating-the-physical-body-via-amplifying-and-creating-a-new-body" id="dissociating-the-physical-body-via-amplifying-and-creating-a-new-body"><h3>Dissociating the physical body via amplifying and creating a new body</h3></a>
<p>When you feel relaxed, begin to focus on your body (Stay aware of your breathing nonetheless) and “amplify” the feeling of your body, feel absolutely everything of your body, do that for a few minutes.
Then pretend that this body is in fact your new body, a body that is different from the real physical one and continue amplifying it as long as you wish, the more you do it, the more dissociation.</p>
<p>The most straightforward way to create the feeling of that body being different is to, well, feel it.
Convince yourself that this new body you’re in isn’t the one you had just a few minutes ago.
For possibly more effective dissociation, create the illusion that your new body has more features (e.g different body shape, wings, etc...)</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dissociating-your-thoughts-andor-emotions" id="dissociating-your-thoughts-andor-emotions"><h2>Dissociating your thoughts and/or emotions</h2></a>
<p>Dissociation from your thoughts is rather easy, this is just simple meditation in the end. Focus on your breathing, keep track whenever your breathe in or out.
You cannot block thoughts or emotions, but doing so will put them in the background, you acknowledge them, but you let them pass, you don’t get stuck on a specific thought.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dissociating-from-vision" id="dissociating-from-vision"><h2>Dissociating from vision</h2></a>
<p>Done in conjunction of physical body dissociation, this is possibly the most powerful form of dissociation, it will very quickly lead to very vivid hypnagogia and possibly dreams.</p>
<p>This is going to sound quite weird, but in a nutshell what you want to do is to “visualize visualization” and you want to keep going down this path as much as you can. So in the end you may “visualize visualizing visualization” and so on...
Don’t worry too much about what this means or the details, just try to do whatever feels right.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#extra-tips" id="extra-tips"><h2>Extra tips</h2></a>
<p>What you can do for extra focus &amp; relaxedness, you can perform the 4-7-8 breathing technique which is explained by this awesome man!</p>
