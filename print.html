<a class="header" href="print.html#the-basics" id="the-basics"><h1>The Basics</h1></a>
<p>So you're interested in lucid dreaming, great!
Welcome to the start of your journey into entirely different worlds.</p>
<p>This guide will explain the basics of lucid dreaming, basic terminology, and how
to get yourself started with the most basic of lucid dreaming techniques,
&quot;reality checks&quot;.
From there it will guide you into what to try next in your lucid dreams, the
basics of dream control, and what other lucid dreaming techniques to try.
This guide is ordered in sequence of what information will be most relevant to
you at your level of understanding after reading the previous chapter, but it
can be read in any order you want.</p>
<p>Remember to relax and stay persistent, this might take a while.
Enjoy the ride, even if you <em>really</em> want to reach the destination!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#wait-what-is-lucid-dreaming" id="wait-what-is-lucid-dreaming"><h2>Wait, what is lucid dreaming?</h2></a>
<p>Lucid dreaming as its very basic form is being aware that you're dreaming.
This is also called being &quot;lucid&quot;.
If this sounds completely normal to you, you may be someone who naturally lucid
dreams.
Most people don't naturally do this however, and have to train themselves to
become lucid in dreams.
The term is also used as an umbrella term for actually making use of this
lucidity.
Being lucid gives you a lot of power over the dream world itself, you can do
anything you want in a dream.</p>
<p>If you've never heard of this before, this may sound like a concept completely
foreign to you, or even like pseudoscience paranormal gobbledygook.
Lucid dreaming however is widely acknowledged as a real thing, even in
psychology.
Everyone can learn to lucid dream and there's nothing paranormal about it.
While for some people it can be a jumping board into paranormal experiences,
this book will not go into that or comment on the validity of it.
If you're interested in these things that's alright, you do you, this book just
won't help you with that beyond lucid dreaming itself.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#but-its-a-dream-wont-it-all-feel-fake" id="but-its-a-dream-wont-it-all-feel-fake"><h2>But it's a dream, won't it all feel fake?</h2></a>
<p>It's technically all imagined yes, but that doesn't mean it's not real to your
mind.
Lucid dreams can feel incredibly real, or even hyper-real as your senses in
dreams are not filtered interpretations of your real life sensory organs, but
direct feeds from the dream world.
People who wear glasses generally don't need them in dreams.</p>
<p>This is not to say that dreams are indistinguishable from real life, in fact
there's a lot of things that are very different.
These are just part of the experience, and allow you to change the world around
you, your own appearance, travel to different locations quickly, or do various
other interesting things you can't do in real life.
Opening a door in a dream for example might lead nowhere, or somewhere
completely unexpected.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#but-i-dont-have-any-dreams" id="but-i-dont-have-any-dreams"><h2>But I don't have any dreams</h2></a>
<p>Yes you do! Everyone has dreams, the hard part is remembering them.
But you can train this!
This guide has some tips and tricks on how to improve your dream recall from
nothing, to multiple dreams per day.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#i-need-this-right-now-whats-the-fastest-way-to-do-this" id="i-need-this-right-now-whats-the-fastest-way-to-do-this"><h2>I need this <strong>RIGHT NOW</strong> what's the fastest way to do this?</h2></a>
<p>Woah there, calm yourself down a bit.
Lucid dreaming certainly is very appealing, and a great experience, but rushing
to it won't work.
There is no fastest way or quick easy way to reach a lucid dream, it takes time
and persistence, and figuring out what works for you.
(No matter how much some supplement sellers would like to convince you otherwise)</p>
<p>If you're not feeling comfortable in your own body, or are suffering from
problems in your life, you may feel like you absolutely <em>need</em> to learn this.
This however will work against you.
Take a step back, figure out your life, talk to a therapist.
Escaping into a lucid dream won't solve any problems for you, no matter how much
it sounds like a panacea.</p>
<p>You need to approach lucid dreaming with patience.
It's likely that it's going to take some time before you get into a lucid dream
where you can actually do the things you want to do.
Enjoy the journey.
Enjoy the benefits you get from all the techniques that help you achieve lucid
dreams.
Enjoy the weird experiences you get that aren't lucid dreams but still something
different, something unique.</p>
<p>Take your time, enjoy the small victories and benefits, and before you know it
you're suddenly standing in your own personal world, able to do whatever you
want.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#okay-how-do-i-start" id="okay-how-do-i-start"><h2>Okay, how do I start?</h2></a>
<p>Great!
Welcome to the start of your journey.
Move on to the next chapter of the guide.</p>
<p><em>This guide is still being written, the next chapter isn't finished yet, instead
go to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/">Lucid Dreaming Subreddit</a></em></p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#techniques" id="techniques"><h1>Techniques</h1></a>
<p>This is a collection of guides for various techniques for inducing and improving
lucid dreams.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#bild-barrier-induced-lucid-dream" id="bild-barrier-induced-lucid-dream"><h1>BILD (Barrier Induced Lucid Dream)</h1></a>
<p><strong>BILD</strong> is a way to get lucid in your dreams via barriers that you set up.</p>
<p>It can be any kind of barriers at all, the general idea of it is that those barriers will help you become lucid by putting you or even forcing you into a mindset to become lucid.</p>
<p>Eventually, because of the barriers, you'll do a reality check, feel or notice that something is wrong, or perhaps even notice the barriers themselves.</p>
<p>This technique can grant you <strong>omnilucidity</strong> in a very simple and fast manner.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#what-is-omnilucidity" id="what-is-omnilucidity"><h3>What is omnilucidity?</h3></a>
<p><strong>Omnilucidity</strong> is when you are lucid in every single dream you have.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#setting-up-a-barrier" id="setting-up-a-barrier"><h2>Setting up a barrier</h2></a>
<p>In order to set up a barrier, you will first need to have a lucid dream through other means. (DILD, MILD, WILD, ...)</p>
<p>Once you are in a lucid dream, you're going to want to go (Preferably) to your bedroom, or to any place of your choice where you'd like to setup a <strong>spawning point</strong>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#a-spawning-point-wha" id="a-spawning-point-wha"><h3>A spawning point? Wha?</h3></a>
<p>Yes, either your bed or a place of your choice, when setting up the barriers, you will spawn there every dream, it will make sense as you continue reading the guide.</p>
<p>Now that you have chosen the place where you'd like to spawn, you need to demark the spawning zone in some way, and in this example we're gonna use &quot;magical auras&quot; to demark the spawning zone.</p>
<p>Wave your hands around as if you were going to do some magic, like energy manipulation, focus this energy and send it towards your spawn point as it slowly marks the contours of the spawn zone you wish. You should start to see a magical aura go out from your hand, and it will slowly trace the contours of your spawn point.</p>
<p>At the same time this happens, set up the following rules, either by thinking them, saying them out loud, or maybe even chanting it:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;From now on, I will spawn in (Your place of choosing) in every single one of my future dreams.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I cannot go through the barriers, so long as I am not lucid.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;If I am out of the barriers, I am already lucid.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>That is about it, that's the general idea on how you should proceed for it, but of course you can get creative and use something else instead of &quot;magical auras&quot; or perhaps even differently worded rules.</p>
<p>And now your barriers are done! Congrats! But you're still not quite there just yet...</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#persisting-the-barriers" id="persisting-the-barriers"><h2>Persisting the barriers</h2></a>
<p>Now that you have setup your barriers, you'll need to make them persistent, so that it actually carries out to your future dreams.</p>
<p>Doing so is fairly simple and may take anywhere from a day to a few days.</p>
<p>You'll need to meditate and visualize those barriers you've just made. Visualize possible scenarios about it might play out in your next dream.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#heres-an-example" id="heres-an-example"><h3>Here's an example</h3></a>
<p>Start your meditation, when you feel like it, start visualizing the beginning of a dream, you'll start at your spawn zone, still not lucid and unaware that this is a dream.
However because of the rules you've just set, you'll be stuck in this spawn zone, so you might try to get out or wonder why you cannot get out, <em>and that's the thing, that is the trigger for lucidity</em>.</p>
<p>You will extremely likely start to ask yourself legitimate questions about why this is happening, may it be a dream? You will reality check at this point or just know you're dreaming. Tada!</p>
<p>Now you are able to go through the barriers and get out of the spawn point because you are lucid now!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#after-a-day-or-a-few-days-of-meditation-and-visualization" id="after-a-day-or-a-few-days-of-meditation-and-visualization"><h3>After a day or a few days of meditation and visualization...</h3></a>
<p>That's it! The barriers have now carried over to your future dreams, and now you will be getting lucid every dream! You'll spawn at your spawn point, you will be stuck in this spawn point as the barriers do not let you through. You'll wonder why this happens and suspect this is a dream, thus doing a reality check, and becoming lucid!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#maintaining-the-barriers" id="maintaining-the-barriers"><h2>Maintaining the barriers</h2></a>
<p>Alright, it isn't <em>that</em> easy, you still have to maintain your barriers from time to time because they will slowly fade out eventually, leaving you with normal dreams again.</p>
<p>Once a week, simply go back to your spawn point and restrengthen your barriers by giving it some more energy, you can give some of your energy just like in the barrier induction part, or you can do something else that makes sense to you, get creative!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#help-my-barriers-are-fading--not-as-effective" id="help-my-barriers-are-fading--not-as-effective"><h3>Help! My barriers are fading / not as effective</h3></a>
<p>If your barriers start to fade, depending on the severity, you can meditate and visualize it to restrengthen it a little bit, go into a lucid dream, and restrenghten it from there.
Or if it's too severe then I'm afraid you'll have to go back to <a href="print.html#setting-up-a-barrier">setting up a barrier</a>, pay attention next time!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dissociation" id="dissociation"><h1>Dissociation</h1></a>
<p>Dissociation is the practice of &quot;letting go&quot; of your physical body, thoughts &amp; other senses.
Doing so can result in much more relaxed and focused meditation, much better visualization, along with easier dream induction via WILD or similar means.</p>
<p>You can dissociate pretty much any time you'd like, provided you are in a comfortable position and with minimal or no outside disturbances (Auditory, etc...), it is preferable to keep your eyes closed while dissociating.</p>
<p>For all of these methods, start by going into a comfortable position (If you're unsure, just do the corpse position, lie on your back, arms lying down on the sides, no crossing of the legs).
Then close your eyes and begin some meditation at first, simply focus on your breathing for a few minutes.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dissociating-the-physical-body-via-ignoring-it" id="dissociating-the-physical-body-via-ignoring-it"><h2>Dissociating the physical body via ignoring it</h2></a>
<p>When you feel relaxed, begin to slowly ignore your body in an incremental manner, first your toes, then feet, legs, hands, arms, chest, torso and finally head.
If you keep focus on your breathing at all times, you'll find that it becomes much easier to dissociate.</p>
<p>If on purpose ignoring a certain part of your body doesn't make sense, that's alright.
Not everyone can do that easily.
Try one of the following two alternatives instead.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dissociating-the-physical-body-via-amplifying-and-ignoring-it" id="dissociating-the-physical-body-via-amplifying-and-ignoring-it"><h3>Dissociating the physical body via amplifying and ignoring it</h3></a>
<p>If dissociating through simply ignoring your body doesn't quite do the trick or takes a long time, you can try this method instead which may provide better results.</p>
<p>When you feel relaxed, begin to focus on your body (Stay aware of your breathing nonetheless) and &quot;amplify&quot; the feeling of your body, feel absolutely everything of your body, do that for a few minutes.
Then just suddenly ignore your body, shift your focus to solely your breathing only and dissociation will carry out very fast.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dissociating-the-physical-body-via-amplifying-and-creating-a-new-body" id="dissociating-the-physical-body-via-amplifying-and-creating-a-new-body"><h3>Dissociating the physical body via amplifying and creating a new body</h3></a>
<p>When you feel relaxed, begin to focus on your body (Stay aware of your breathing nonetheless) and &quot;amplify&quot; the feeling of your body, feel absolutely everything of your body, do that for a few minutes.
Then pretend that this body is in fact your new body, a body that is different from the real physical one and continue amplifying it as long as you wish, the more you do it, the more dissociation.</p>
<p>The most straightforward way to create the feeling of that body being different is to, well, feel it.
Convince yourself that this new body you're in isn't the one you had just a few minutes ago.
For possibly more effective dissociation, create the illusion that your new body has more features (e.g different body shape, wings, etc...)</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dissociating-your-thoughts-andor-emotions" id="dissociating-your-thoughts-andor-emotions"><h2>Dissociating your thoughts and/or emotions</h2></a>
<p>Dissociation from your thoughts is rather easy, this is just simple meditation in the end. Focus on your breathing, keep track whenever your breathe in or out.
You cannot block thoughts or emotions, but doing so will put them in the background, you acknowledge them, but you let them pass, you don't get stuck on a specific thought.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#dissociating-from-vision" id="dissociating-from-vision"><h2>Dissociating from vision</h2></a>
<p>Done in conjunction of physical body dissociation, this is possibly the most powerful form of dissociation, it will very quickly lead to very vivid hypnagogia and possibly dreams.</p>
<p>This is going to sound quite weird, but in a nutshell what you want to do is to &quot;visualize visualization&quot; and you want to keep going down this path as much as you can. So in the end you may &quot;visualize visualizing visualization&quot; and so on...
Don't worry too much about what this means or the details, just try to do whatever feels right.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#extra-tips" id="extra-tips"><h2>Extra tips</h2></a>
<p>What you can do for extra focus &amp; relaxedness, you can perform the 4-7-8 breathing technique which is explained by this awesome man!</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gz4G31LGyog" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>It helps you focus, it helps you relax, it helps you sleep faster, it relieves anxiety and you can get quite euphoric from it.</p>
